# Employee Directory ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-jamjon94-green)

## DESCRIPTION

This application is great for employers who need to sort and search through a list of their employees! It is currently made with an employee generator, but in the future we may be able to incorporate an adding function so that one can add their actual employees instead!

This project was made with React and was very difficult to accomplish, but I am proud to have done so and feel like this homework helped me understand React more!
